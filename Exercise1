Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Solution :


array=[]
for i in range(2000,3200):
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5 != 0:
        array.append(str(i))
print(','.join(array))


Using class and object concepts:

class Exercise1(object):
    array=[]

    def __init__(self,strt,end):
        self.start=strt
        self.end=end
        
    def divisibleBy7(self):
        for i in range(self.start,self.end):
             if i%7 == 0 and i%5 != 0:
                self.array.append(str(i))
        return (','.join(self.array))
                
obj=Exercise1(2000,3200)
print(obj.divisibleBy7())
